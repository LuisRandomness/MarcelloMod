# MarcelloMod
(Currently for version 1.20.4, and the Fabric modloader. Forge/NeoForge ports might not happen due to the sour taste its management has given me, and this mod should work on Quilt anyway)

Pseudo-remake of a Minecraft mod created by MoldyGH with MCreator, being simply a parody mod on a YouTube user by the name of *Marcello_TIMEnice30*, and the *Vs. Dave and Bambi* mod for *Friday Night Funkin'* (probs).

The mod in itself is **NOT** in a playable state (mobs and ores do not spawn in the world, for example), so I'd not advise you to play the mod if you're searching for survival content.

If you do want to play the original Minecraft mod this is based on (and is playable for the most part), download it from here. https://moldygh.itch.io/marcellomod
